'All three of us arise from the trench to inspect what my bomb did.'

'It did little to nothing, just a small pancake-sized crater on the ground, with all the leaves around it swept away from the source of the explosion.'

'I pat myself down, in case there were any stray bits of shrapnel or wood that may have grazed me anywhere.'

mc'You guys good? Did you get hit anywhere?'

'I can only hear the bassy parts of my voice, listening to everything else is like trying to hear through some thick pillows.'

'I see Kara and JJ check themselves before saying some things to me, reassuring nods are given out to clear up any misunderstandings.'

'I guess it\'\s about the ensuing police response, but I\'\m not too concerned with that.'

'I spot a white bit of shrapnel embedded in the trunk of a nearby tree.'

m'It\'\s to get in line with all of the other sister schools we\'\re partnered with.'

m'St. Hewlett\'\s College isn\'\t the only sister school of Kuribayashi High, so there\'\s a big chance that there will be other transfer students like you.'

mc'Huh, interesting.'

'The thought of some other person that also understands English to a native level at my school brings an odd comfort.'

'Not to discredit Monika\'\s proficiency in English, but talking to her just has that one extra added layer.'

'A language barrier that\'\s practically not there, but it shows itself whenever I have to get really complex thoughts across.'

'Something that I really don\'\t have to worry about when I talk to JJ or Mom.'

'That being said, I hope I don\'\t find myself taking Monika\'\s understanding of the English language for granted.'

'Especially when she\'\s essentially self taught as far as I know, on top of her English-related material in school and her father\'\s extracurricular lessons.'

'...'

'Hmm.'

'I wonder how a meeting between Monika\'\s father and I will go.'

'Going off of what Monika\'\s father\'\s occupation is, as well as what I\'\ve heard from what Monika said from the night I got here, I think Monika\'\s father is pretty much a native speaker.'

'Gotta count my blessings here, because if I eventually do meet him I won\'\t have to faff around a language barrier.'

'Especially when I\'\ve gotta explain what my relationship is with his daughter when I\'\m pretty much living with her until the end of the year.'

'I\'\m sure it\'\ll be fine but I can\'\t help being a little anxious, I guess I\'\ll ask Monika when he\'\ll return so I can mentally prepare myself.'

mc'Hey Monika, do you know when your father will come back to visit?'

m'Hmm?'

'Oh, he usually comes back for a month in...'

m'June?'

m'Why do you ask?'

mc'Well, I\'\ve been thinking about how your father would react when the transfer student that his daughter was assigned to is a guy.'

mc'I get the feeling that it\'\ll go well, but I also suspect that he won\'\t be entirely keen on me living with you.'

m'Oh...'

m'About that...'

'Monika\'\s sudden change in demeanour doesn\'\t really give off any winning cues.'

'I think I\'\ve found my answer.'

m'Let\'\s just say that the phone call my Mom had with him, she only referred to you with \"\they\"\ and \"\them\"\.'

'Yeah.'

'Not good.'

'Monika huffs and loosens up a bit.'

m'And what about your Dad? Is he okay with you going overseas for school?'

mc'Oh him? I\'\m fairly certain he would be fine with it.'

mc'Any time I would go out he\'\d always tell me to, at the very least, not end up in the news, hospital or prison.'

mc'...and to not add or subtract the population.'

mc'Though, I can\'\t really confirm how he feels about it since I can\'\t really talk to him anymore.'

m'Oh! I\'\m... sorry to hear that.'

'I catch a whiff of sorrow from Monika, turning to her and seeing her a little downcast.'

mc'Oh no no no, he hasn\'\t passed away, he\'\s just...'

# 「Natsuki! Sayori!」

# A pair of vibrantly coloured heads of hair reveal themselves as soon as Monika and I turn a corner.

# 「Oh? Really?」

# Sayori
# 「Yeah! We saw him under a bridge just eating grass while we were coming over to the mall.」

# …?

# Is Mr. Tucks some famous local bum or something?

# 「When we got closer though he got scared and ran away.」

# 「We were following him and then you two caught up to us.」

# Monika
# 「Hmm.」

# 「Sounds like we’re in for some good luck to the start of this year.」

# Natsuki
# 「Heh, only for us though, you and your boyfriend still haven’t caught up with him.」

# Monika promptly blushes while I throw Natsuki a malicious eyebrow.

# MC
# “Wanna run that by me again?”

# Natsuki
# 「Uhh, what?」

# MC
# 「You know I can understand you right?」

# Natsuki
# 「Heheh, that’s why I said it.」

# 「But if you’re going to bug me in English you can forget it.」

# MC
# 「Is that so…」

# I stick my tongue out, a universal sign meaning ‘get lost’, or at least, I think it is.

# My conclusion about my universal dismissive gesture seems to be corroborated by Natsuki following suit.

# Natsuki
# 「Blehhh.」

# MC
# “Blehhh.”

# My little quarrel with Natsuki gets a few laughs out of the administrative heads of the literature club.

# Still, I gotta know if we’re gonna run into this elusive ‘Mr. Tucks’. I ain’t fixin’ to get stabbed by a free ranging homeless guy.

# I know the type extremely well, I just know some shit’s gonna go down if we see him.

# 「Sayori, you saw this Mr. Tucks when you were walking over here? Are we gonna see him again?」

# Sayori
# 「Probably, he ran off this way so we’ll probably catch up to him.」

# Shit.

# 「What’s wrong MC?」

# MC
# 「Oh, nothing.」

# Sayori
# 「C’mon, you’ll love him!」

# MC
# 「I’m afraid I don’t swing that way, Sayori.」

# “Aww? The fuck you mean ‘Aww’?”

# Monika
# “Well, MC, you’re not from around here so I thought you’d be…”

# “You know…”

# MC
# “I would say ‘sorry to disappoint’ but we both know how little that means at this point.”

# Monika
# “Hmph.”

# “Still, you’re the only guy in a literature club full of girls, so you’re either a pervert there to ogle a bunch of girls or…”

# MC
# “Oh come on, either choice isn’t really fair.”

# Monika
# “Is there something wrong with being a little…”

# “Festive?”

# Festive, huh? Haven’t heard that one yet.

# MC
# “No, nothing’s wrong with it, it’s just not who I am.”

# “And I ain’t a pervert either.”

# “Promise.”

# Monika
# “I would take that promise, but we both know how little that means at this point.”

# MC
# “*sigh*”

# “Touche.”

# …[scene change]

# Natsuki and I have been standing outside the same clothing store for a good 20 minutes.

# MC
# “*Huff*”

# These feet were made for walking, and I’m starting to get a little sore.

# New places get real familiar once you stand around doing dick all for nearly half an hour.

# It’s gotten to the point where even the swimsuit section’s practically burned into my peripheral vision, vibrant hues caking their negative colours into my retinas.

# …

# I’m bored out of my mind.

# I should’ve never come here.

# I should’ve expected something like this would happen.

# Just a girls’ day out at the mall, o’ what could that entail?

# Monika and Sayori went off into the depths of that self-imprisoning retail chain, with the former leaving me in Natsuki’s ‘care’.

# Of which more or less involved her giving me a couple of glances before quickly turning her gaze back to her phone, just standing next to me.

# She seems to be more and more wired up with each passing moment.

# Her looking around, tapping her feet, ritualistically pulling out her phone, glancing at it then putting it back.

# That look of deep discomfort.

# I can’t just ignore it anymore.

# MC
# 「Are you okay?」

# Natsuki
# 「Yeah.」

# MC
# 「You don’t look like you’re okay.」

# Natsuki
# 「So? Why do you care?」

# MC
# 「Because I don’t want to stand around doing nothing.」

# 「I want to talk to you.」

# Having a bit larger vocabulary in Japanese would be a big plus, having Natsuki or anyone else roll their eyes at me would be a less common sight.

# Natsuki
# 「Ugh, I should’ve came here on my own so I wouldn’t have to babysit Monika’s pet.」

# MC
# 「Excuse me?」

# Natsuki
# 「What, you don’t understand Japanese anymore?」

# MC
# 「I understood you perfectly.」

# Natsuki
# 「Then what didn’t you get?」

# Yeesh.

# And now she’s back to being her wired old self last seen not a mere moment ago.

# MC
# 「Wait.」

# 「Why did you say you should have come here on your own?」

# Natsuki recomposes herself to a more relaxed state with the tapping ceased as she pulls out her phone from her pocket.

# She presents her phone to me with a web page for a bookstore on it.

# I’m assuming it’s inside this mall.

# Natsuki
# 「I was planning to go here to pick up a book I want but I got hitched to loverboy here, and now the book I want is about to go out of stock.」

# I get back at her and roll my eyes.

# You will rue the day I learn some more Japanese to quip at you back, Natsuki.

# At least I found out why she’s all twitchy and anxious now.

# MC
# 「How far is the store?」

# Natsuki
# 「Just on the other side of this mall.」

# MC
# “The fuck are we waiting for? Let’s go.”

# Natsuki
# 「Huh?」

# MC
# 「I said let’s go, then.」

# Natsuki
# 「But, Monika-」

# MC
# 「I’ll tell her.」

# 「Don’t worry.」

# With that, Natsuki scrambles off in the opposite direction where we approached the store we were standing outside of with me tailing her.

# …[scene change]

# The eternity the both of us found ourselves in mere minutes ago really pumped us up as we’re speed walking down the length of the mall.

# Well, speed walking for Natsuki, somewhat expedited walking for me.

# Our difference in height is what’s making me put in a conscious effort to pace myself correctly to not bump into her.

# Then of course I would also have to not scrape my toes against her heels because of our difference in strides.

# All of this effort could have gone to waste four abrupt turns ago.

# …

# Whup!

# Make that five.

# Keeping track of Natsuki wouldn’t be so much of a problem if she were a little taller.

# Pink hair’s pretty hard to lose track of, which is especially useful considering the amount of turns we’re making.

# I trust Natsuki’s judgement in finding the shortest path to wherever we’re going though, but this feels a little drawn out.

# Like, how big is this damn mall?

# Every last turn felt like I’m being plunged deeper into a labyrinth of commerce.

# …

# Whup.

# There’s another one.

# I’m tempted to look back and see how far we’ve gone.

# Hmm.

# A quick glance wouldn’t hurt.

# I turn to see even more mall.

# Each and every bit of it is more unrecognisable as the rest.

# Taking a peek to see our progress was kinda stupid, considering the amount of turns we took.

# There was no way we would’ve stayed on the same straight line at this point.

# Anyways, back on track.

# I turn back towards Natsuki-

# Oh.

# Shit.

# I lost her.

# Uhhh.

# Okay.

# Don’t panic.

# The worst thing to do right now is panic.

# Uhhh.

# We were going…

# This way?

# Yeah, that seems about right.

# I’m trying to look out for a pink head of hair, which is made all the more difficult by the vast amount of people that are also out doing their Sunday shopping.

# I should probably keep going this way.

# …

# …

# Yeah no, I’ve completely lost her.

# Ergh… No!

# No no no!

# Huhh.

# …

# I guess now’s a good time than ever to let Monika know Natsuki’s dragged me off to fetch a personal errand of hers.

#  I pull my phone out of my pocket to notice a thin patch of thigh sweat has caked itself on my phone’s screen.

# MC
# “Eugh.”

# I wipe it off with my jeans, taking note of how sweaty I get when I get all anxious and panicky. 

# Messages

# Monker

# Wait a sec-

# Who’s that in the background in Monika’s profile picture?

# Oh, it’s Sayori.

# I would've guessed they’d be close friends, especially when the pair of them meandered off to do some window shopping.

# Then actual shopping.

# “Hey natsukis taking me to a book shop in case if you were wondering”

# Monika
# “Okay, just stay close to her.”

# MC
# “K will do”

# Ooof.

# I can sweep this minor mishap under the rug.

# That is if I can catch up to Natsuki.

# …Of which I cannot, for the life of me, can spot.

# In my very limited time in knowing her she woulda continued hauling ass to her destination, arbitrary turns and all.

# I guess I oughta do the same.

# Phone time.

# Maps

# ‘「Bookstores」’

# Search

# Oookay, let’s see.

# Mmm, too bougie.

# …

# Too far.

# Too specialised.

# Witches’ apothecary- what the fuck? How is this a bookstore?

# …

# Too small- oh actually…

# This might be the one Natsuki showed me earlier.

# On closer inspection this is the exact bookstore.

# …

# Okay, just a three minute walk away, let’s go.

# …[scene change]

# These directions were a lie.

# I’ve been plunged deeper into the heart of this mall.

# I’m fairly certain this constitutes trespassing. 

# I know old habits die hard but this time it’s unintentional.

# Though it’s not like anyone’s gonna know, I haven’t seen another person in the past few minutes.

# Which is strange, I would’ve suspected these corridors to have workers pushing carts around or something along those lines.

# Sucks to be them though, each one of these passes just seem to go on forever until it intersects with another perpendicular hall.

# The only thing keeping me company is the incessant hum-buzz of the incandescent lights above.

# Aside from that and my footsteps, everything else is dead silent.

# The rabble of a Sunday’s mall seems like a distant memory to me now.

# …[time forward]

# The ETA set by the app has long passed.

# Every turn I take my phone spits out a new route that leads me to nowhere.

# …

# Okay, another turn.

# Woah, woah! Jesus.

# Almost lost my balance.

# I place a hand on a cold concrete wall while I pull out my phone to see if I’m still going in the right way.

# …

# Yeah, I figured it would be in the complete opposite direction.

# I take my hand off the wall, trying my best to regain my composure.

# Which evidently isn’t good enough at all as I topple over to the opposite side of the hall, firmly knocking myself in the head.

# I can feel myself get a little more dizzy every single 180 I take when I reach an intersection.

# Am I turning too fast? Am I doing this to myself?

# Have I suddenly become claustrophobic, making these halls look smaller and smaller as time goes on?

# Is there a concoction of chemicals left over from operations and construction that’s vaporised in the air that I’m just now feeling the effects of?

# Is it a mix of all of these factors including the fact that I headbutted the wall a moment ago?

# Well, whatever it is, staying here is most certainly not a good thing.

# Not for my personal health nor my already spotty record.

# …

# MC
# “Huh?”

# I just heard something.

# A door opening somewhere.

# Shit.

# Shit shit shit.

# I am NOT going to get caught out trespassing here!

# C’mon phone!

# …

# Are you shitting me? I was just there!

# You know what, fuck you, I’ve got a better idea.

# I’ll just run completely straight in one direction.

# …

# Yeah no, those footsteps aren’t getting any farther, gotta go.

# I bolt down the length of the hallway I’m in, completely the opposite direction to where I heard that sound a moment ago.

# If no one knew I was here they sure do now, me hauling ass isn’t exactly stealthy, especially when my runners squeak against the floor like an NBA match.

# Especially when I’m about to slam into double crash bar doors-

# MC
# “Oomph!”

# I stumble for a bit before picking up speed again.

# Looking ahead I see…

# Even more corridor.

# It just doesn’t end!

# I pick up the pace again.

# I start to notice other stuff on the walls that don’t seem familiar.

# A crack here, a safety poster there, a different coloured pipe on the ceiling. 

# These little things give me a little more motivation to run a little faster.

# …

# Hey, I haven’t seen that door before-

# Oh fuck- It just opened!

# My runners squeak as I take a left to another corridor and bolt.

# I spot a singular crash bar door at the very end.

# This looks very promising-

# Eurgh, what’s that smell?

# It’s like a mix of every single cleaning chemical under the cupboard!

# Nope!

# “*cough cough*”

# That is definitely not good to breathe in.

# The stench grows stronger.

# Every stride I take becomes more uncalculated and uncoordinated, a step too far or too short would send me straight to the floor.

# Every hurried breath of air saturates my lungs with stinging vapour. 

# Every gasp is akin to swallowing knives.

# The chemicals are in the way of the clean air I so desperately need.

# Haste and desperation clouds my higher judgement as the door grows bigger in my vision.

# I can barely think.

# Having a closer look of it, there’s a window just above its crash bar.

# I ready myself to make contact with the door.

# [instant scene change]

# “Mmf!”

# ???
# 「Eep!」

# MC
# “*cough cough*”

# ???
# 「What the…」

# I hear the door close so forcefully behind I feel a small gust as I put my hands on my knees.

# I’m caught between taking gasps of air and coughing.

# I can physically feel the good air flush out the bad air from my lungs.

# It’s a good half minute of hacking my lungs out when I realise someone’s been standing right next to me the entire time.

# I get up from my dazed state to appear semi-functional to the people around me.

# …

# Oh.

# Natsuki
# 「Weren’t you just behind me?」

# MC
# 「Yes.」

# 「I lost you while we were coming here.」

# Natsuki
# 「What? How?」

# MC
# 「I uhh…」

# 「Wanted to see how far we walked.」

# 「So I looked behind me.」

# 「And then I didn’t see you.」

# Natsuki
# 「...」

# 「Lemme guess, I’m too short and you lost me in the crowd?」

# MC
# “...”

# “Well, when you put it like that-”

# Natsuki
# 「Speak Japanese!」

# MC
# 「Right. Sorry.」

# I tense up and position my body like I’m about to defuse a bomb.

# 「Yes, you… 」

# 「...are?」

# Fuck.

# Death approaches in measured tippy taps.

# Please don’t blow up.

# “Look man, you were turning so many damn times-”

# Natsuki
# 「Blegh-」

# 「*cough* Ergh, why do you smell like that?」

# MC
# 「Yeah, about that…」

# 「My phone directed me through a path that wasn’t correct.」

# She waves a hand in front of her to disperse any more of that god-awful stench away from her nose and mouth.

# Natsuki leans to her left to take a peek behind me whilst small coughs escape her mouth.

# I turn around to do the same.

# The door I rammed through a moment ago is thoroughly shut.

# I peer through the window, following Natsuki’s suit.

# We spot a figure in the distance carrying a pair of gas tanks, donning a full face respirator.
